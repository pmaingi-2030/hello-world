# hello-world
just another repository

I am interested in learning how to code and have all the scripts i develop open for the scientific community here.
I am hoping to make maximum use of the resources present here to better my skills

I am going through how to create branches in github and why they are actually important in reviewing changes before commiting them to the main branch.
So you can pull a request once you have confirmed the changes you want to commit to your main branch from the branch you are actually having the preliminary changes on.
