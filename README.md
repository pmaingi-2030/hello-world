# hello-world
just another repository

I am interested in learning how to code and have all the scripts i develop open for the scientific community here.
I am hoping to make maximum use of the resources present here to better my skills

I am interested in programming using R, Python and Ruby. I am conversant with shell scripting and R but I would like to improve on my expertise in the two. My current experience is in gut microbiome data analysis but i would like to advance further into genome wide association studies. I hope to make use of github to better my skills in GWAS.
